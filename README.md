In this project, I use a heatmap to show a summary of Kickstarter projects data.

The heatmap shows:
1. Sum of invensments in Kickstarter projects by year, country and in total.
2. Rate of succeeded projects, a binary variable- High in this country is above 50% Rate of succeeded otherwise Low.
3. Active countries- show in which country there is open projects in the data.

you can enter a variables like- category, goal ,country and more and see if your

project will success and a simillar projects from the data.
